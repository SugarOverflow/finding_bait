#finding_bait

We were challenged to create a game using a child's plush toy. 
So we designed "finding bait" in reference to Finding Nemo.

A simple snake game was programmed with sounds and interactive graphics in ProcessingJS 
and interfaced with an Arduino UNO board that was connected to an accelerometer
and placed inside the child's fish toy

The child could then move the fish toy in order to move the fish to capture the food in the game
(in this case the fish tail would  be the snake lol)
